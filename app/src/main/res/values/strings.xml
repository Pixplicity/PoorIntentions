    <string name="explanation_main_1">This app consists of two screens: MainActivity and DetailActivity. The app can only exist in one of two states:</string>
    <string name="explanation_main_2">Unfortunately, due to a peculiarity in Android, launching an app that is already running might result in it entering an invalid state:</string>
    <string name="explanation_main_3">This issue can best be reproduced by launching an app from its Google Play details page, navigating to DetailActivity, pressing home, then launching it from the app drawer.</string>
    <string name="explanation_main_4">When the resolution is enabled, this app will pop up a toast displaying \"Task resuming\" when the issue is detected. The resolution is simply to finish the excess instance of MainActivity when it is started by a launch intent but is not the task\'s root activity.</string>
    <string name="continue_details">Continue to detail screen</string>

    <string name="task_resuming">Task resuming</string>

    <string name="explanation_detail_1">DETAIL</string>
    <string name="explanation_detail_2">Now press the home button and launch the app in a different way. For instance, open the Google Play details page and hit \"Open\" from there. You should expect the app to open to this screen, right?</string>
