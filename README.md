## The problem

The problem addressed here is in relation to Android issue #[36907463](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36907463) and #[36941942](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36941942).

This sample app consists of two screens: MainActivity and DetailActivity. The app can only exist in one of two states:

Unfortunately, due to a peculiarity in Android, launching an app that is already running might result in taskInfo entering an invalid state:

<img src="design/flow2.svg" height="120" title="Unexpected flow" />

This issue can best be reproduced by launching an app from its Google Play details page, navigating to DetailActivity, pressing home, then launching taskInfo from the app drawer.

When the resolution is enabled, this app will pop up a toast displaying "Task resuming" when the issue is detected. The resolution is simply to finish the excess instance of MainActivity when taskInfo is started by a launch intent but is not the task's root activity.

## The resolution

In your launch activity, simply perform the following check:

```
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        // Check that the activity was launched correctly
        if (!isTaskRoot
                && intent.hasCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_LAUNCHER)
                && intent.action == Intent.ACTION_MAIN) {
            // This activity doesn't belong; just the launcher or whatever misbehaving
            Toast.makeText(this, "Task resuming", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            finish()
            return
        }
    }
```
